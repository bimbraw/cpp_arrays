Array exercises for C++

Exercise 1. Write an application that asks the user to input four numbers. The inputted numbers should be stored in a 4 element array of doubles. The numbers should be summarized and the result printed in the console as well as the address of first and last element of the array.

Exercise 2. Create a two dimensional 3x3 array of integers that holds some numbers of your choice (each array cell should be initialised in program). Write a program that asks the user to input x and y numbers (from 1 to 3). The program prints out in the console the value that is stored in the array cell numbered by x, y coordinates. Take into consideration that coordinates starts counting from ONE when array starts counting from ZERO.
